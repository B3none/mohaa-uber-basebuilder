// advert time and advert-delay
//
// advert-time is the time it waits before showing all the messages again. 
// for example. IT would wait 5 minutes then show all the messages. Then it goes
// back to waiting 5 minutes.
//

// advert-delay is the time between each message shown. So after the advert-time it 
// starts showing the messages. After the message is shown it waits this time before showing the next message
// 


// Advert-colour
// You can set the colour for each message to display in the 4th section of the message. You can either
// set a RBG value or you can set "random". If this 4th section is left blank then the "advert-colour"
// will be used.
//
// Advert-colour is the same as the colour section of the message. It can either be "random" or a RGB colour
// value like "1.0 0 1".
//
// RBG means RED, GREEN, BLUE
// So to make a colour simply use your knowlegde from primary school on mixing the primary colours red, green and blue.
//
// "1 0 0" = red, because it is 1 red, 0 green and 0 blue.
// "0 1 0" = green, because it is 0 red, 1 green and 0 blue.
//
// Because "R G B" stands for red green blue. where a number is set gives the amount of colour. 0 gives no colour.
// so to get purple, that is red and blue we would do "1 0 1".
