Hello everyone! I am the great person who created a very well done basebuilder called Uber Basebuilder ( latest version at http://medalofhonor.filefront.com/file/Uber_BasebuilderUber_Death_SoundsTHE_FALLS_BASEBUILDER;93165 ) Some of you know about it, tried it out, seen the server that uses this mod, or haven't heard about it at all. This news is for the people who have and/or use it. That was an unfinished and very buggy version of my mod that I was so desperate to tell the world about. After that version was published, I noticed numerous bugs in every single map that includes my mod.

I started to fix them, and also finish the single player maps, so people can fully enjoy my mod with all of its aspects on all your favorite single player maps. Before I post my next version, 5.5, I wanted some ideas first. If there are any maps that you want my great mod on, or if you have an idea about something I could add to my mod, post here, email me at searingwolfe@gmail.com, or xfire me (my username is searingwolfe). 

If someone actually does look through the .pk3 file of my mod, you might see things like drivable vehicles that I did not include in the mod. That is because they are either extremely buggy, or I had other plans with them, that I simply cannot do by myself. Now, I've been making this mod ever since I was just turning 12 years old, I am now 13, and I'm still working on this mod. Sadly, I have gotten to a point where I can no longer complete this mod without the help of some great modders out there. One of my modders, that recently started helping me, named IcE1337 (If you've seen him lately, please contact me) has gone out of contact for a very long time. Without him, I am lost. 

He helped me mod the awesome pack of weapons that I have not published yet, and he also gave me a big idea. He said, "You know, it would be nice to have a map or two without basebuilder, just to make the majority of the mod more fun." This was something I never have and never could think about. He first decided we should make a simple Capture The Church mod on The Crossroads map. He pretty much did the entire mod while I was swimming in my pool (I had no idea he was already making it). When I came back to my computer two and a half hours later, he already finished. He sent it to me, and it didn't work out perfectly. So we helped each other out to complete it. Ever since that, I have lost contact with him. 

Now for the main reason why I posted this news, if there are any experienced modders out there, and you are willing to help, please contact me at searingwolfe@gmail.com, or xfire me (My username is searingwolfe). I have much more plans for much more interesting mods that aren't about basebuilder.
