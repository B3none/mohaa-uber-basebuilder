<><><>Info<><><>

When you find this trigger, you will become a bush. The trigger looks like a bush as well, so it shouldn't be hard to find. This trigger is only on the multiplayer stock maps, St. Renan, St. Lo, and The Falls.

<><><>Advantages<><><>

If you stay still, you will look just like a casual bush. When you shoot with your weapons,  they make no sound, just like the invisible trigger. Most of the levels have the bush item that you can build. If you build a bunch of bushes, and use the camo trigger, you will never be found!

<><><>Disadvantages<><><>

When you are a bush, the leaves are normally in the way of your view. Meaning, it can be hard to see.
