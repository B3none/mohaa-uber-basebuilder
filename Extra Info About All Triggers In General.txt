<><><>Info<><><>

All the secret triggers are placed in corners around each map. They can be very frustrating and hard to find, but eventually, you'll find one. On a lot of the levels, the really hard triggers, such as the invisible and invulnerable trigger, are on top of roofs, or on a place where you can't get to it without building a way up to it, or using a jetpack.
