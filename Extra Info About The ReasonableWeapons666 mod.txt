This is a weapon mod that spices up your server, if you want it. Before anyone hates it, it is NOT a realism mod. Even though it says ReasonableWeapons, doesn't mean that they are. Some weapons are more rigged than others. Rigged Weapon means that it is a weapon that you either can't get unless you find the all weapons trigger, or you can only get it if you pick it. Normal Weapon means that you start out with it. All the weapons have scopes, except for the grenades, colt 45, and walter p38.
