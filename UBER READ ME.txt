*****************************************************************************UBER BASEBUILDER 6.0*****************************************************************************
<><><>Intro<><><>

Hello everyone! after months of bug fixing, and adding new features to UBER BASEBUILDER, I welcome you version 6! This mod includes the full basebuilder mod on every single map yes, even the void level xD! If you are currently running this mod on another server, this is a MUST for your UBER BASEBUILDER server. It also includes Elgan's Admin Menu, since much of the mod was based off basebuilder and the admin pro (planes, jetpacks, etc.). If you don't want the admin pro, you don't have to use it. You can go into your controls and set a key for the Admin_Menu if you want. Also, when you are building, you can use cheats like noclip to help you build. You must type cmd noclip in console for it to work. When building is over, cheats are automatically deactivated, so you can't use dog or noclip after building. THIS MOD WILL ONLY FULLY WORK ON MEDAL OF HONOR ALLIED ASSAULT!

<><><>How To Install<><><>

I'm going to type out the step-by-step directions for how to install this (just in case noobs see this). Open up the .zip file that you downloaded, and put the UBER BASEBUILDER .pk3 file into your MOHAA\main folder (usually at C:\Program Files\EA GAMES\MOHAA\main). To get into C: you have to open My Computer and click Local Disk [C:]. If you want some really cool modded weapons, put the ReasonableWeapons666 into your MOHAA\main folder as well. And just a reminder, this mod only FULLY works for Allied Assault.

<><><><><><><><><><>

<><><>How To Uninstall<><><>

To Uninstall this, simply delete or take the UBER BASEBUILDER.pk3 out of your MOHAA\main folder. To uninstall the weapons, take it out of your MOHAA\main too. Make sure to keep these files too, just in case you want to play it again :D
