//
//Bugnading is a word to describe the action of holding a grenade 
//through a door, or sometimes a wall untill it blows up. When it 
//blows up the holder does not get hurt, as the grenade is physicly 
//on the other side of the door/wall. This also means anyone on the 
//other side can get killed by the grenade. This fix detects when a 
//player has 'bugnaded' and imediatley kills the player and removes 
//a set amount of kills. This issue effects Spearhead and Breakthrough 
//only.
//
//You can edit the text/values between quotes ( "" ) below to change some settings.

	level.bugnadesettings = makearray
	// The number of kills to remove from a player who is detected bugnading.
	//The player also looses 1 for suiciding, so -3 in total (if you choose -2).

	//The message the player says when he is detected bugnading:
"I was caught bugnading* and it cost me 3 kills."

	//The message displayed to all players on the server, explaining what bugnading is:
"* Bugnading = blowing up grenades through walls/doors, to either prevent your own death, or kill people on the other side"

	//The message displayed on the bugnader's screen after he is caught:
"You have been caught bugnading. E.G you held a grenade in or through a door/wall untill it blew up."
