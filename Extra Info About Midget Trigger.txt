<><><>Info<><><>

The midget trigger is simply a trigger that makes you a scale .5 person. You will be half as small as you normally are. When you kill someone, they will think, "Wow, how did I die to a midget, when the weapons are bigger than his body?"

<><><>Advantages<><><>

Your small size will be very hard for someone to shoot you. Your small size can also hide behind crates and other objects, even though you see as if you are still normal size.

<><><>Disadvantages<><><>

There aren't really any disadvantages to being a midget, except the fact that it makes it hard for you to build when you're tiny.
